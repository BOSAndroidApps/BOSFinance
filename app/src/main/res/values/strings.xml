    I hereby confirm that I am a citizen of India and competent to give this declaration/undertaking and to execute and submit this application form and all other documents for the purpose of availing loan, creation of security, and representing generally for all the purposes mentioned/required.

    I confirm that all the particulars and information given in the application form and otherwise in writing or over any contact option by me are true, correct, and complete, and no information has been withheld or suppressed.

    I confirm that I am submitting this application after reading and fully understanding the terms and conditions of availing a loan from OQ Pay. I understand that OQ Pay is entitled to reject my application without assigning any reason.

    I confirm that no insolvency proceedings are against me, and I have never been adjudicated insolvent. No suit for recovery of dues or criminal proceedings is pending against me. No person’s consent is required for availing the loan. The loan amount will not be used for gambling, lottery, races, or any other illegal purpose as prohibited by RBI or regulatory authorities.

    I understand that OQ Pay offers different interest rates based on loan amount, tenure, down payment, payment history, credit score, income, documents provided, and other required information.

    I confirm that I have issued post-dated cheques towards EMI repayment and authorize OQ Pay to present them on due dates.

    The dealer confirms joint and several liability for loan repayment.

    The address on my Aadhaar card is correct. Any communication sent there shall be deemed duly served.

    Disputes arising from this agreement will be referred to a sole arbitrator appointed by the lender. Arbitration will be held in Nagpur, in English.

    The dealer guarantees EMI payment.

    You authorize OQ Pay to act upon instructions/applications sent via contact options (e.g., email, SMS) regarding your loans.

    Interest rates are based on various borrower-related factors. You agree to abide by such assessments. Interest is calculated using a flat rate over the entire loan term and will be appropriated based on the monthly reducing balance.

    If EMI is not paid, the lender may block the mobile phone until dues are cleared.

    You should pay the monthly installment by the recommended date to ensure timely credit to your loan account.

    All mentioned fees include applicable GST at 18% (integrated tax).
